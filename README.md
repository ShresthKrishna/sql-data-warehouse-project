# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project



## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a **data warehouse** from multiple source systems, integrating them into a unified analytical model, and delivering actionable insights through SQL-based analytics and reporting.

---

## 📂 Specifications

- **Data Sources**  
  Import data from two source systems: **ERP** and **CRM**, provided as CSV files.

- **Data Quality**  
  Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis (e.g., missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats).

- **Integration**  
  Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly **data model** optimized for analytical queries.

- **Scope**  
  Focus only on the latest dataset — **historization of data is not required**.

- **Documentation**  
  Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both **business stakeholders** and **analytics teams**.
